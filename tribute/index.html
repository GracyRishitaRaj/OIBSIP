      <h2>Inspiration by Subash chandra bose</h2>
      <p>
        Subhas Chandra Bose (23 January 1897  to 18 August 1945) was a prominent Indian 
        nationalist leader and a key figure in the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule.
         He is known for his unwavering dedication to the cause of Indian independence and his contributions to the 
         struggle for freedom
      </p>
      <p>
        Early Life and Education: Subhas Chandra Bose was born in Cuttack, Odisha, India. He came from a well-educated and influential Bengali family. He studied in England, graduating with honors in philosophy from the University of Cambridge.

Leadership in the Indian National Congress: Bose was initially associated with the Indian National Congress (INC) and was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent approach. However, he later became dissatisfied with the INC's moderate stance and sought more radical means to achieve India's independence.

      <blockquote>
        "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom"
      </blockquote>

        This famous slogan is often associated with Subhas Chandra Bose. He believed in a more militant approach to achieving India's independence and was willing to make sacrifices for the cause.
